<li>Why I make this post. Why I like Rain World, Transition to Karma</li>
</ul>

<p>The Karma System has strong potential as a way to gate progression, heighten tension, and and align the player's incentives with the avatars <strong>(SEE: Immersion, Ludonarrative/LudoWorld Dissonance, and Engagement)</strong>. When it works, it ensures players achieve mastery in an area before allowing them to progress to more challenging areas. It generates tension by raising the stakes to stay alive, which pushes players to prioritize survival. This alignment of the Player's incentives with the character he embodies within the world creates a deep sense of immersion.</p>

<p>Ultimately the Karma system works to achieve these goals by punishing death, which forces players to engage with the game's mechanics more seriously. Giving death consequence amplifies potential frustration with deaths that seem arbitrary or outside the control of the player. Greater engagement means greater scrutiny towards punishment for deaths that might be a product of poor design decisions. As a result, a system that introduces a consequence for failure is a double edged sword:  Death with consequence can have sweet rewards, but requires laser tight design; frustrated players become less immersed as they become more aware the design shortcomings that are punishing them.</p>

<p>Rain World is not a game for everyone. It lives on as a cult classic with a strong modding community, but it had a launchy rock with a polarized reception. Frustration was abound with the lack of guidance, masochistic difficulty curve, and Karma system.</p>
