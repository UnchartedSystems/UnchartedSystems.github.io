</ul>

<p>EXAMPLES:</p>

<ul>
<li>Halo</li>
<li>Uncharted</li>
<li>Total War Political System</li>
<li>Dark Souls</li>
</ul>

<p>Halo campaign: at its best vs cheesing with shields at a distance</p>

<p>Uncharted campaign: at its best vs cheesing with regen at a distance</p>

<p>Dark Souls: at its best vs running past enemies</p>

<p>You can often see difference by looking at promos or trailers vs gameplay</p>

<p>Players effectively roleplay to compensate for imbalance</p>

<p>Sometimes these strategies require skill but work against the nature of the game, sometimes these strategies do not require engaging with many game systems (cheese)</p>

<h3 id="what-strategies-are-stimulating-challenging-fun-what-experience-are-we-aiming-for">What strategies are stimulating, challenging, fun? What experience are we aiming for?</h3>

<p>Good design means aligning optimal strategies within the desired strategy space</p>

<p>Regen Health:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create carrots and sticks that drive players towards action</li>
<li>Uncharted 1 had limited ammo, pushing players forward to keep stocked</li>
<li>Many Design Avenues for Halo: (some more expensive then others)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Combat area has shelter from wraiths / Phantoms</li><br />
<li>Lower Effective Ranges on Weapons</li><br />
<li>Higher Enemy Accuracy as Distance increases</li><br />
<li>Enemy Mortars that cut off in proximity</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Dark Souls</p>

<ul>
<li>Carrots and Sticks</li>
<li>Enemies that gatekeep environmental progression<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Either through chokepoints</li><br />
<li>Or through death progression mechanism</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Enemies that accelerate as you run</li>
<li>Long Interruptible Fog/Gate Animations (not really ideal, but cheap)</li>
<li>Running eats stamina faster -> Tired Run</li>
<li>Enemies chasing you may run into boss room (technical limitations?)</li>
</ul>
