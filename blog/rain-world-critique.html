<h3 id="karma-system-heightens-risk-reward-of-death">Karma System heightens risk reward of death</h3>

<ul>
<li>Great concept, but also emphasizes game's design problems</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="linearity-clashes-with-emergent-design">Linearity Clashes with Emergent Design</h3>

<ul>
<li>Many regions resemble "an open world of linear paths" where progress to certain nodes is highly dependent on creature luck. (picture of nodes of ideal system++)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="camera-and-pipe-creature-sensitivity-responsible-for-most-arbitrary-deaths">Camera and Pipe / Creature sensitivity responsible for most arbitrary deaths</h3>

<ul>
<li>Obviously frustrating, arbitrary: creates dissonance between player and creature that hampers immersion</li>
<li>Has deep design implications: disincentives open room design which worsens single path / linearity problems</li>
<li>Makes it vague to gauge if screen boundaries lead to another screen or to offworld death</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="game-design-leads-to-dead-ends-and-traps">Game Design Leads to Dead Ends and Traps</h3>

<ul>
<li>Poor Karma Gate design can lead to being trapped on the wrong end of a difficulty spike. (eg: Chimney Canopy)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Solutions:</li><br />
<li>Ensure higher difficulty side of any gate has a lower karma requirement (one that can be reached within close proximity of gate habitats)</li><br />
<li>Crossed Gates no longer require Karma?</li><br />
<li>The last Crossed Gate remains open until another gate is crossed</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>World design often leads to dead end sinks: areas that are easy to get to but incredibly difficult to get out of. (eg: Bottom of the Garbage Wastes)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Potential Solution: One Way tunnels: allows designers to develop escape hatches for difficult sinks without trivializing the difficulty getting there</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Progression often demands crapshoot 'leap of faith' exploration or prior experience of the map. This clashes with the intended experience of emergent survival</li>
<li>Prey respawn seems poorly balanced with Karma / Death. Low Karma Slugcats can have a very difficult time finding food in a long term habitat.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="criticism-of-matthewmatosis-appeal-to-nature-is-cruel">Criticism of Matthewmatosis appeal to 'nature is cruel'</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cruel deaths that are not a product of the emergent ecosystem but are a product of arbitrary design decisions or stifling linearity do not develop the experience of an unforgiving hostile ecosystem. They instead develop a greater awareness of design shortcomings. They detract from the player's sense of place and immersion rather than build it.</li>
</ul>
