<h3 id="karma-system-heightens-risk-reward-of-death">Karma System heightens risk reward of death</h3>

<ul>
<li>Why I make this post. Why I like Rain World? Transition to Karma</li>
<li>The intention of the Karma system was to push the player towards continued survival. Idea has some strong merits<br />
<ul><br />
<li>It ensures players achieves mastery in an area before allowing them to progress to more challenging areas</li><br />
<li>It generates tension by raising the stakes to stay alive</li><br />
<li>Most importantly shapes players incentives so that their playstyle embodies slugcats incentives within the gameworld, which makes the gameplay click, generates ludonarrative harmony, and immerses the player further</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>The Karma system achieves this goal by punishing death.<br />
<ul><br />
<li>This amplifies potential frustration with deaths that feel like the result of arbitrary things outside player control or with deaths that are a product of poor design decisisons</li><br />
<li>Karma system was criticized on release for being frustrating or arbitrary, but the Karma system only heightens the consequences for death, and so all it does is amplify frustration with other mechanics in the game</li><br />
<li>This frustration pushes players towards greater scrutiny of the game's design and structure. Players become more acutely away of the games faults as a result</li><br />
<li>This system is a double edged sword: frustrated players are LESS immersed then the baseline</li><br />
<li>Death as consequence can have sweet rewards, but requires tighter design</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Rain World had a polarized reception<br />
<ul><br />
<li>I love the game, it is a cult classic, but also was panned by some on release who fell on the side of frustration</li><br />
<li>(pic of bad review)</li><br />
<li>Not arguing it will ever be loved by all, but we should consider what merits pans may have</li><br />
<li>Consider when frustration is an unavoidable product of the desired experience, and when it is a product of design shortcomings</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>(WARNING) On Difficulty<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Offering ideas/solutions to design shortcomings that generate death and frustration will reduce the difficulty</li><br />
<li>That does not mean I believe that difficulty should be reduced or the challenging nature of the game be changed</li><br />
<li>Instead, eliminating arbitrary or poorly designed difficulty mechanics gives us room to ramp up the difficulty in other ways that bring us closer to our desired experience</li><br />
<li>This takes us furthur from a 'difficult' experience that kills us arbitarily and closer to difficulty we can strategize about and develop mastery</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="camera-and-pipe-creature-sensitivity-responsible-for-most-arbitrary-deaths">Camera and Pipe / Creature sensitivity responsible for most arbitrary deaths</h3>

<ul>
<li>Static camera in open enviros is most obvious design shortcoming<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Creates arbitrary frustrating deaths based on screen transition creatures</li><br />
<li>Screen transitions are disorienting, particularily mid jump (ask rain world for places to gif this)</li><br />
<li>(pictures)</li><br />
<li>Vertical transititions are particularily tight</li><br />
<li>Makes area boundaries ambigious: is there a screen below me or is that death?</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>More than that tho, static camera has deep design implications<br />
<ul><br />
<li>disincentives open room design which restricts world design space and worsens linearity problem</li><br />
<li>single screen rooms that then make up norm are inherently harder to build more options into</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>(Note) Modders are making progress on this!!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="linearity-clashes-with-emergent-design">Linearity Clashes with Emergent Design</h3>

<ul>
<li>One element of frustration Rain World's world design often plays as an 'open world of linear paths'</li>
<li>Often, progression or survival is dependent on single paths</li>
<li>(show picture of node graph)</li>
<li>These single paths do not play well with emergent ecosystem, a bad spawn can create huge unavoidable difficulty spikes</li>
<li>Often, secondary paths around are too far to reach after committing to first path and are also luck dependant linear paths</li>
<li>Frustration of the high impact of luck is amplified by karma system that may require multiple consecutive runs</li>
<li>Moreover, these areas bring us further from the game's strong point: emergent ecosystems that allow for a range of strategies and choices</li>
<li>strict linearity does not feel like a natural part of an ecosystem, weakens immersion</li>
<li>Solutions:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Linearity can still be a useful tool: building atmosphere, transitional areas, story elements</li><br />
<li>More linear sections should have purpose / be sparse, treated with care regarding creature spawns</li><br />
<li>World design should be more integrated, allow for strategizing about trade offs between routes</li><br />
<li>(show pic of nodes)</li><br />
<li>'randomness' should inform tradeoffs and present novel strategy space to adapt to, not make or break run </li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="game-design-leads-to-dead-ends-and-traps-you-are-here">Game Design Leads to Dead Ends and Traps YOU ARE HERE</h3>

<ul>
<li>The game is littered with 'Difficulty Sinks' are easy to get into, but difficult to get out of</li>
<li>They can be caused by poor karma gate design, where the cost of moving back into an easier region can trap the player on the hard side. (eg: Chimney Canopy)</li>
<li>(show pic of Chimney Canopy Karma Gate, posted below)</li>
<li>Solutions:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Ensure higher difficulty side of any gate has a lower karma requirement (one that can be reached within close proximity of gate habitats)</li><br />
<li>Crossed Gates no longer require Karma?</li><br />
<li>The last Crossed Gate remains open until another gate is crossed</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>(Show pic of Garbage Wastes wall)</li>
<li>They can also be caused by gravity, making it easy to get down but hard to get back up. (eg: Bottom of the Garbage Wastes)<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Potential Solution: One Way tunnels: allows designers to develop escape hatches for difficult sinks without trivializing the difficulty getting there</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Progression often demands crapshoot 'leap of faith' exploration where the time invested into moving to a new area prohibits turning around if the path ends in a dead end</li>
<li>This forces the player to take a trial and error approach until he has developed prior experience of the area he is moving to<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Trial and error is a poor fit for a game that imposes a cost on death</li><br />
<li>this game loop of trial and error, throwing slugcat's life away to gain info on the path ahead, does not match the internal motivations of the slugcat, which lessons the immersion of surviving as an agent in a food chain</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overall-shifting-difficulty-wip">Overall: Shifting Difficulty WIP</h3>

<ul>
<li>Most solutions outlined would in practice, lower the perceived difficulty of the game</li>
<li>Rain World should be a very hard game, difficulty and consequence heighten intended experience</li>
<li>The goal here is to shift the source of difficulty from design shortcomings that undermine immersion towards a more authentic difficulty that plays on the depth of the game's mechanics and increases immersion</li>
<li>So, after taking away, we now have to add.</li>
<li>WIP<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Upping spawns because players have more options</li><br />
<li>Integrated world design for regions</li><br />
<li>High risk / reward feeding grounds (pic of feeding grounds)</li><br />
<li>Node maps explaining ideas</li><br />
<li>Greater hunger?</li><br />
</ul></li>
</ul>
