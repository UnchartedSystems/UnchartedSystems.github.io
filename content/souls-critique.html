<ul>
<li>Game developed around its own conventions rather than progressing and changing conventions in pursuit of the initial intended experience</li>
<li>As a result, fights tended towards more and more perfection, more bonfires as compensation, particularily bonfires in front of bosses</li>
<li>This is in contrast to the original vision set out by Demon Souls and to a lesser extent Dark Souls, where bossfights concluded the end of the level. Traversing the level itself often took up the brunt of playtime and difficulty.<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Bosses compounded the need for mastery over the exploration of the level, as improvements over the exploration lead to a better position at the start of the boss, the boss was an extension of performance over the level.</li><br />
</ul></li>
<li>Over time, as bonfires have been more prevalent and in front of bosses, the mechanical execution required for the boss itself has shot up to an absurd degree.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, exploration requires design work to prevent rampant cheese of running? sidenote?</li>
<li>Time spent learning and playing the boss has risen dramatically relative to time spent exploring and learning the level as a whole</li>
<li>Meta progression has constantly demanded more mechanical precision, we have gone from a set of mechanics designed to emulate a certain action adventure experience, to an experience that has become too self referential, and is based on abusing i-frame windows in rolls to exploit precise attack patterns</li>
<li><p>Parallel to Super Meat Boy</p></li>
<li><p>Sekiro is slightly refreshing, same rote memorization and mismatch between the emphasis on bosses vs exploration, but on other hand, combat feels more aggressive, not sure about this?</p></li>
